Course Project

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.<br>
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.<br>
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set<br>
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.<br>
5.Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.<br>
6.Steps to work on this course project<br>

Download the data source and put into a folder on your local drive.
Put run_analysis.R in the working folder then set it as your working directory using setwd() function in RStudio.
Run source("run_analysis.R"), then it will generate a new file tidy_data.txt in your working directory.
